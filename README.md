# BullsEye-iOSGame

Bullseye is an iOS game where the user attempts to match the slider on screen as close as possible to the target value. The closer the slider is to the target, the more points the user is awarded! 

- If the user matches the slider perfectly, they are given an additional 100 bonus points! 
- The points are added up as rounds progress and the game can be restarted at any moment by hitting the reset button. 
- Clicking the 'i' button takes the user to the information and rules screen.
